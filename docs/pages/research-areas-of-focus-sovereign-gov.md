## Area of Focus: selfdriven Sovereign Gov Kit, an Open Framework for Community-Driven, AI-Assisted Governance

“Governance is not a platform for control — it’s a system for collective self-actuation.”

## Purpose

The **selfdriven Gov Kit** empowers any organisation, community, or region to **govern with AI** — not by replacing humans, but by **training intelligence systems around verified community intent**.

It mirrors the mission of AI-powered policy simulation and sovereign decision systems but focuses on **progressive self-governance**, **SSI sovereignty**, and **educational participation**.

## Core Outcomes

|  Outcome | selfdriven Gov Kit Equivalent |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| **AI-powered policy forecasting** | AI-assisted *reflection & projection engine* that models the social, economic, and environmental outcomes of community actions |
| **Sovereign compute infrastructure** | *EntityOS-based data sovereignty layer* using Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Cardano root-of-trust |
| **Governance App Store** | *selfdriven Interface Hub* — modular governance “skills” for policy, learning, health, environment, and finance |
| **Multilingual governance co-pilots** | *Community AI Assistants* that speak local dialects, reference local law/policy, and surface verified institutional data |
| **Open international collaboration** | *Network of selfdriven Institutes* forming a federated *Learning Governance Network (LGN)* linking research to policy |

## System Architecture

### Layer 1 — Human-AI Interface
**Goal:** Make civic reasoning interactive and transparent.  
**Modules:**
- *Reflect & Project*: conversational tool for simulating governance choices  
- *Deliberation Copilot*: AI assistant that summarises, compares, and verifies options  
- *Citizen Mirror*: personal reflection space where users see how their choices affect shared goals  

### Layer 2 — Trust & Identity
**Goal:** Ensure verifiable, consent-based participation.  
**Modules:**
- *DID & VC engine (EntityOS)* — individuals and organisations anchor decisions to verifiable credentials  
- *Proof Ledger* — all actions hashed on Cardano (CIP-68 metadata)  
- *Privacy envelope* — selective disclosure for collective deliberation  

### Layer 3 — Governance Engine
**Goal:** Simulate, forecast, and test community policies.  
**Modules:**
- *Policy Flow Simulator* — turns decisions into visual systems maps (social, financial, environmental)  
- *Outcome Forecaster* — AI-driven projection model that uses real and proxy data  
- *Feedback Loop* — converts simulation results into updated learning goals  

### Layer 4 — Interface Hub (Gov App Store)
**Goal:** Modularise and share governance intelligence.  
**Modules:**
- *Governance Skills Marketplace* (open source modules for sustainability, budgets, wellbeing, etc.)  
- *Metrics Commons* (shared schema for evaluating governance performance)  
- *Data Connectors* (hooks for local and global datasets)  

### Layer 5 — Federation & Research
**Goal:** Link communities to regional, national, and global intelligence networks.  
**Modules:**
- *Governance Network (GN)* — nodes operated by selfdriven.network operators  
- *Federated Model Exchange* — share trained governance models (LLMs, decision trees, causal graphs)  
- *Inter-Community Governance Dialogues* — cross-community reflection sessions via multilingual co-pilots
